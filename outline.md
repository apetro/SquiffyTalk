# A show-and-tell about Squiffy

## What’s Squiffy?

Squiffy is a tool for building simple interactive fiction.

It's a language, that builds on Markdown.

It's a compiler, from the Squiffy text language to HTML+JS.

It's a development environment GUI.

## What can I do with it?

You can build interactive fiction.

Simple, basic interactive fiction.

Or non-fiction, for that matter.

## How does it work?




## It’s a compiler!


## What is there to appreciate about this?

+ Sometimes, less is more.
+ Sometimes, less is less.



## Would this be a fun way to do WPS newsletters, onboarding, documentation?

## Expert systems?

An expert system is a deterministic logic tree.

These are radically less computationally expensive than Machine Learning.
They're deterministic and we can explain what they're doing. Someone programs them.

## What can I learn from this?

Constraints, tradeoffs in
Open source Software development is hard, yo

### Complexity and emergent interestingness

So here's an interesting thing to think about.

What makes something interesting? Effective?

It's having the right complexity.

Not just any complexity. That's chaos that becomes noise that becomes entropy that is the very opposite of interesting.

Effective complexity. The right complexity.

That's what makes for apparent intelligence.

Maybe a hard concept to convey. Or maybe there's nothing here.

But, for example,

### Learn more about interactive fiction

+ [IF50 substack](https://if50.substack.com/) (50 years of text games)
+ [50 years of text games book on kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aaronareed/50-years-of-text-games) (I backed it; you're welcome to borrow it for a read when it fulfills; also [available for pre-order](https://50-years-of-text-games.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders).)

### Enjoy some interactive fiction

+ [IFComp competition period](https://ifcomp.org/about/comp) is open through Nov 15. Appreciate and even judge some new interactive fiction.
+ [IFDB](https://ifdb.org/) - the Interactive Fiction Database.
+ [Legacy of Dragonholt](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/234669/legacy-dragonholt) - a print product that showcases some of what the genre can do in print form. Looks like [you could pick up a decent condition copy at e.g. Noble Knight for ~$40](https://www.nobleknight.com/P/2147682738/Legacy-of-Dragonholt). Or you're welcome to borrow my copy. 10/10 would recommend; one of my favorite things; not for everyone, you might not like it.

### Make some interactive fiction

+ [Squiffy](https://textadventures.co.uk/squiffy) - one of the simplest, and most constrained, toolsets. A fine place to start. But probably unmaintained.
+ [Twine](https://twinery.org/) - maybe the next one to try. Nice tooling.

And there's a bunch of other toolsets to try beyond these.
